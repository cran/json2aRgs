Description: The function get_parameters() is intended to be used within a docker container to read keyword arguments from a .json file automagically. A tool.yaml file contains specifications on these keyword arguments, which are then passed as input to containerized R tools in the [tool-runner framework](<https://github.com/hydrocode-de/tool-runner>). A template for a containerized R tool, which can be used as a basis for developing new tools, is available at the following URL: <https://github.com/VForWaTer/tool_template_r>.
